# Change Log
-----Milestone 2-----
-HTML/CSS: Integrated bootstrap to HTML tags and polished design for a more visual appeal (2.5 hours)

-JavaScript: Created a mostly functional calculator and like button! (8 hours)

-Downloaded git (command line) to computer, used for a few local commits, also using Github Desktop. (.75 hours)

-Started to redesign the calculator with React Hooks + Typescript, I didn't understand how to structure the calculator before today's lecture. (1.5 hours)


-----Milestone 1-----

-HTML: Added multiple types of text, links, and a title

-Git: Added a background (shoutout to XP), changed some colors, and designed a calculator. 

 -JS: Created a like button that increments up by one each time clicked. 
 

# TODO

- Design another app (To-Do List? game?) and have minimum viable product by milestone 3
- 
- Keep polishing UI with bootstrap



# Failures
- React...trying to run when I should be crawling. After the second day of learning just what HTML/CSS/JS was, I tried jumping right into React. I didn't even understand what the DOM was yet and couldn't conceptulize how to manipulate an HTML doc with a doc.JS linked. I get it now, but I should have set the treadmill to 2mph instead of 7mph right from the start. 
- Git. I didn't realize I could open an HTML doc from file explorer and manipulate the portfolio basically in real-time. For the first week I would make a git commit, push, wait for and view my website url. Now I have like 40 pushes that look like garbage. I figured it out though. 
- Trying to be too resourceful. For my adult life, I have become very resourceful and try t exhast EVERY resource before asking someone for their opinion or help. That's cool and all, but when there are 10,000 websites describing React and JS, it's probably better to give it an hour of searching, then hit up the dicord. There is no use in banging your head against the wall because of pride.
